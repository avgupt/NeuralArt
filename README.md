## Neural Style Transfer
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique takes two images 
* a content image 
* a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter) 
and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but  “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

## How the application works?
